## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - "Genesis" ðŸš€

This is the initial release of TrainingHost, a complete GPU training automation system. 

**What's New:**
- Complete automation from infrastructure provisioning to training execution
- Flask web interface with real-time updates  
- Real-time progress monitoring and logging
- Secure SSH-based remote execution
- Environment-driven configuration for easy customization
- Comprehensive documentation and contribution guidelines

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure your `.env` file with repository and dataset URLs
3. Set up DigitalOcean credentials
4. Launch the web interface or run training directly

**Cost Considerations:**
- GPU instances are automatically destroyed after completion
- Default timeout is 2 minutes (configurable)
- Monitor your DigitalOcean billing dashboard

**Known Limitations:**
- Currently supports DigitalOcean only
- Single GPU instance training
- Manual SSH key setup required

**What's Next:**
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, GCP)
- Distributed training capabilities
- Enhanced cost optimization
- Training result artifact storage
